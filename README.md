Hi, I am Lorenz, a passionate software developer from Germany. I enjoy Gamedev and Web, primarly in my favorite language Rust, sometimes Go and of course JS/HTML/CSS for anything frontend related.

I also very much enjoy graphics programming, networking and anything Linux.

My current web goat: Nginx -> Docker -> Axum -> Maud -> Htmx
