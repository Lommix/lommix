Hi, I am Lorenz, a web/game developer from Germany. Fueled by an insatiable curiosity to constantly acquire knowledge and discover innovative concepts, my journey has taken me from hardware engineering to embedded systems
and ultimately to the realm of web and game development.

I am a rust addict, living the good life, eating only the finest meals of verbose complexity. I can no longer take other languages seriously.
If you think otherwise, skill issue. Triggered? Good! Fight me!
